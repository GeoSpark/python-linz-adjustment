LINZ.adjustment package
=====================

This provides a basic network adjustment module and program, LINZ.Geodetic.Adjustment

Currently this is written primarily to support the pyaxis program, so the feature set
is limited to what is required for that usage.  Important omissions at the moment are

   Proper handling of coordinate systems
   Time dependent coordinates/deformation
   Many observation types

Currently includes:
   LINZ.Geodetic.Adjustment module
   snappy
